Overview 

The following section of the exam is a lab. In this section, you will perform a set of tasks in a live

environment. While most functionality will be available to you as it would be in a live environment, some

functionality (e.g., copy and paste, ability to navigate to external websites) will not be possible by design.

Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it doesn’t matter

how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.

Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You

can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time

appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the

time provided.

### Answer 51

**CORRECT ANSWER:** C

**Explanation:**

You apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a

name and a value pair. After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that

tag name and value. 

Tags enable you to retrieve related resources from different resource groups. 

This approach is helpful when you need to organize resources for billing or management.

### Answer 53

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-169.webp)

**Explanation:**

Box 1: 6

Two out of three update domains would be available, each with at least 3 VMs.

An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same

time.

As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across

these update domains. This approach ensures that at least one instance of your application always remains

running as the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance.

### Answer 69

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-257.webp)

**Explanation:**

Box 1: Azure application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway supports end-to-end encryption of traffic. Application Gateway terminates the

SSL connection at the application gateway. The gateway then applies the routing rules to the traffic, re-

encrypts the packet, and forwards the packet to the appropriate back-end server based on the routing rules

defined. Any response from the web server goes through the same process back to the end user.

Box 2: Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security

posture of your data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the

cloud - whether they're in Azure or not - as well as on premises.

Box 3: Azure Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to

services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness.

![](image/image-260.webp)

**Explanation:**

Note: The three different storage account options are: General-purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts, General-

purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts, and Blob storage accounts.

	- General-purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts are storage accounts that support all of the latest features for

blobs, files, queues, and tables.

	- Blob storage accounts support all the same block blob features as GPv2, but are limited to supporting

only block blobs.

	- General-purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts provide access to all Azure Storage services, but may not have

the latest features or the lowest per gigabyte pricing.

**CORRECT ANSWER:** B

**Explanation:**

Explanation: 

Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect Azure virtual networks. Once peered, the virtual

networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in the peered

virtual networks is routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, much like traffic is routed between

virtual machines in the same virtual network, through private IP addresses only. Azure supports:

	- VNet peering - connecting VNets within the same Azure region

	- Global VNet peering - connecting VNets across Azure regions

**CORRECT ANSWER:** C

**Explanation:**

The performance diagnostics tool helps you troubleshoot performance issues that can affect a Windows or

Linux virtual machine (VM). Supported troubleshooting scenarios include quick checks on known issues

and best practices, and complex problems that involve slow VM performance or high usage of CPU, disk

space, or memory.

Advanced performance analysis, included in the performance diagnostics tool, includes all checks in the

performance analysis, and collects one or more of the traces, as listed in the following sections. Use this

scenario to troubleshoot complex issues that require additional traces. Running this scenario for longer

periods will increase the overall size of diagnostics output, depending on the size of the VM and the trace

options that are selected.

### Answer 84

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-286.webp)

**Explanation:**

Explanation: 

Box 1: No

Azure Files supports two storage tiers: premium and standard. Standard file shares are created in general

purpose (GPv1 or GPv2) storage accounts and premium file shares are created in FileStorage storage

accounts.

You cannot create Azure file shares from Blob storage accounts or premium general purpose (GPv1 or

GPv2) storage accounts. Standard Azure file shares must created in standard general purpose accounts

only and premium Azure file shares must be created in FileStorage storage accounts only. Premium

general purpose (GPv1 and GPv2) storage accounts are for premium page blobs only.

Box 2: Yes

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) brings additional redundancy to the data storage over both LRS or ZRS.

Along with the three copies of your data stored within a single region, a further three copies are stored in the

twinned Azure region. So using GRS means you get all the features of the LRS storage within your primary

zone, but you also get a second LRS data storage in a neighbouring Azure region. This data is updated

asynchronously, so there is a small lag between the 2 data sets, but for most cases this is acceptable.

Box 3: Yes

Blob Storage Standard can be used both LRS and GRS.

### Answer 88

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-300.webp)

**Explanation:**

Explanation: 

Step 1: Run sysprep.exe on VM1.

If a template, or system image is used, System administrators must run the Sysprep tool to clear the SID

information. The Sysprep tool is usually one of the last tasks performed by a system administrator when

building a server image/template, that way each clone of the template will generalize a new unique SID for

every server image copied from the template and will prepare the server for a first time boot.

The end result is a System template that functions as a new unique build every time it is deployed.

Step 2:  From Azure CLI, deallocate VM1 and mark VM1 as generalized

To create an image, the VM needs to be deallocated. Deallocate the VM with Stop-AzVm. Then, set the

state of the VM as generalized with Set-AzVm so that the Azure platform knows the VM is ready for use a

custom image

Step 3: Create a virtual machine scale set

Now create a scale set with New-AzVmss that uses the -ImageName parameter to define the custom VM

image created in the previous step.

deploying a VM in Azure that runs AD DS as a Domain Controller. This architecture is more common

when the on-premises network and the Azure virtual network (VNet) are connected by a VPN or

ExpressRoute connection.

	- Use Azure AD to create an Active Directory domain in the cloud and connect it to your on-premises

Active Directory domain. Azure AD Connect integrates your on-premises directories with Azure AD.

Box 2: Set up VPN connectivity.

This architecture is more common when the on-premises network and the Azure virtual network (VNet) are

### Answer 100

**Explanation:**

Once the VNets are peered, all resources on one VNet can communicate with resources on the other

Subnet1, which is on Paris-VNet and VMs on Subnet3, which is on AllOffices-VNet will be able to connect to

each other.

All Azure resources connected to a VNet have outbound connectivity to the Internet by default. Therefore

VMs on ClientSubnet, which is on ClientResources-VNet will have access to the Internet; and VMs on

Subnet3 and Subnet4, which are on AllOffices-VNet will have access to the Internet.
