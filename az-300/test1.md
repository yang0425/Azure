### Answer 9

**CORRECT ANSWER:** B

**Explanation:**

The UPN is used by Azure AD to allow users to sign-in. The UPN that a user can use, depends on whether or not the domain has been verified. If the domain has been verified, then a user with that suffix will be allowed to sign-in to Azure AD.

To do so, you need to add and verify a custom domain in Azure AD before you can start syncing the users.

**Explanation:**

You can find unused disks in the Azure Storage Explorer console. Once you drill down to the Blob containers under a storage account, you can see the lease state of the residing VHD (the lease state determines if the VHD is being used by any resource) and the VM to which it is leased out. If you find that the lease state and the VM fields are blank, it means that the VHD in question is unused.

>**Note:** The ManagedBy property stores the Id of the VM to which Managed Disk is attached to. If the ManagedBy property is $null then it means that the Managed Disk is not attached to a VM

### Answer 13

**CORRECT ANSWER:** C

**Explanation:**

We need a separate rule for each condition. We also need a separate action group for each action type that we want to fire when the rule is met.

In this scenario we have three conditions (when any virtual machines are powered off, restarted, or deallocated) and one action type (you are sent an email message).

### Answer 16

**CORRECT ANSWER:** A, D

**Explanation:**

You can create custom, or user-defined, routes in Azure to override Azure's default system routes, or to add additional routes to a subnet's route table. You can specify the following next hop types when creating a user-defined route:

- Virtual appliance: A virtual appliance is a virtual machine that typically runs a network application, such as a firewall. 

- Virtual network gateway: Specify when you want traffic destined for specific address prefixes routed to a virtual network gateway. The virtual network gateway must be created with type VPN. You cannot specify a virtual network gateway created as type ExpressRoute in a user-defined route because with ExpressRoute, you must use BGP for custom routes.

- None: Specify when you want to drop traffic to an address prefix, rather than forwarding the traffic to a destination.

- Virtual network: Specify when you want to override the default routing within a virtual network.

- Internet: Specify when you want to explicitly route traffic destined to an address prefix to the Internet, or if you want traffic destined for Azure services with public IP addresses kept within the Azure backbone network.

Incorrect Answers:

B: You cannot specify VNet peering or VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint as the next hop type in user-defined routes. Routes with the VNet peering or VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint next hop types are only created by Azure, when you configure a virtual network peering, or a service endpoint.

C: You cannot specify a virtual network gateway created as type ExpressRoute in a user-defined route because with ExpressRoute, you must use BGP for custom routes.

### Answer 27

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-45.webp)

**Explanation:**

Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1

The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share

Step 2: Register Server1.

Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service

Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.

Step 3: Add a server endpoint

Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.

A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.

### Answer 30

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-50.webp)

**Explanation:**

IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to:

- Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface.

- Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations.

The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.

Box 1: Yes

The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.

Box 2: No

VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.

Box 3: Yes

The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to connect to VM2 via VM3.

### Answer 31

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-55.webp)

**Explanation:**

Box 1: add an address space

Your IaaS virtual machines (VMs) and PaaS role instances in a virtual network automatically receive a private IP address from a range that you specify, based on the address space of the subnet they are connected to. We need to add the 192.168.1.0/24 address space.

Box 2: add a network interface

The 10.2.1.0/24 network exists. We need to add a network interface.

### Answer 32

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-59.webp)

**Explanation:**

Box 1: No

Azure DNS provides automatic registration of virtual machines from a single virtual network that's linked to a private zone as a registration virtual network. VM5 does not belong to the registration virtual network though.

Box 2: No

Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network.

Box 3: Yes

VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS zone. By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the registration virtual network.
