### Answer 1
**CORRECT ANSWERT:**

![](image/a-1-1.webp)

**Explanation:** 

We cannot just move a virtual machine between networks.  What we need to do is identify the disk used by
the VM, delete the VM itself while retaining the disk, and recreate the VM in the target virtual network and
then attach the original disk to it.

### Answer 9
**CORRECT ANSWERT:** B

**Explanation:**

The UPN is used by Azure AD to allow users to sign-in. The UPN that a user can use, depends on whether
or not the domain has been verified. If the domain has been verified, then a user with that suffix will be
allowed to sign-in to Azure AD.
To do so, you need to add and verify a custom domain in Azure AD before you can start syncing the users.

### Answer 10
**CORRECT ANSWERT:** D

**Explanation:**

In staging mode, the server is active for import and synchronization, but it does not run any exports. A
server in staging mode is not running password sync or password writeback, even if you selected these
features during installation. When you disable staging mode, the server starts exporting, enables password
sync, and enables password writeback.

[Back to questions](#question-11)

### Answer 12
**CORRECT ANSWERT:** D

**Explanation:**

You can find unused disks in the Azure Storage Explorer console. Once you drill down to the Blob
containers under a storage account, you can see the lease state of the residing VHD (the lease state
determines if the VHD is being used by any resource) and the VM to which it is leased out. If you find that
the lease state and the VM fields are blank, it means that the VHD in question is unused.

**Note:** The ManagedBy property stores the Id of the VM to which Managed Disk is attached to. If the
ManagedBy property is $null then it means that the Managed Disk is not attached to a VM

### Answer 13
**CORRECT ANSWERT:** C

**Explanation:**

We need a separate rule for each condition. We also need a separate action group for each action type that
we want to fire when the rule is met.

In this scenario we have three conditions (when any virtual machines are powered off, restarted, or
deallocated) and one action type (you are sent an email message).

### Answer 16
**CORRECT ANSWERT:** A, D

**Explanation:**

You can create custom, or user-defined, routes in Azure to override Azure's default system routes, or to add
additional routes to a subnet's route table. You can specify the following next hop types when creating a
user-defined route:
* Virtual appliance: A virtual appliance is a virtual machine that typically runs a network application, such
as a firewall. 
* Virtual network gateway: Specify when you want traffic destined for specific address prefixes routed to a
virtual network gateway. The virtual network gateway must be created with type VPN. You cannot
specify a virtual network gateway created as type ExpressRoute in a user-defined route because with
ExpressRoute, you must use BGP for custom routes.
* None: Specify when you want to drop traffic to an address prefix, rather than forwarding the traffic to a
destination.
* Virtual network: Specify when you want to override the default routing within a virtual network.
* Internet: Specify when you want to explicitly route traffic destined to an address prefix to the Internet, or
if you want traffic destined for Azure services with public IP addresses kept within the Azure backbone
network.

Incorrect Answers:

B: You cannot specify VNet peering or VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint as the next hop type in user-defined routes. Routes with the VNet peering or VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint next hop types are only created by Azure, when you configure a virtual network peering, or a service endpoint.

C: You cannot specify a virtual network gateway created as type ExpressRoute in a user-defined route because with ExpressRoute, you must use BGP for custom routes.

**Explanation:**

Box 1: Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in a single
region.
* LRS would not remain available if a data center in the region fails
* GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication.

Box 2: StorageV2 (general purpose V2)
* ZRS only support GPv2.

### Answer 27
**CORRECT ANSWERT:**

![](image/a-27-1.webp)

**Explanation:**

1. Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1.

    The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share
2. Register Server1.

    Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
3. Add a server endpoint

    Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint. A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.

### Answer 30
**CORRECT ANSWERT:**

![](image/a-30-1.webp)

**Explanation:**

IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to:
- Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations
assigned to the network interface.
- Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network
interface's IP configurations.

The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives
traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.

Box 1: Yes

The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.

Box 2: No

VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.

Box 3: Yes

The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to connect to VM2 via VM3.
