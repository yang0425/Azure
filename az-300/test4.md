**Explanation:**

A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection is used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. This type of connection requires a VPN device, a local network gateway, located on-premises that has an externally facing public IP address assigned to it.

Finally, create a Site-to-Site VPN connection between your virtual network gateway and your on-premises VPN device.

**Explanation:**

Box 1: An Azure Application Gateway that has a web application firewall (WAF)

Azure Application Gateway offers a web application firewall (WAF) that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.

Application Gateway operates as an application delivery controller (ADC). It offers Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) termination, cookie-based session affinity, round-robin load distribution, content-based routing, ability to host multiple websites, and security enhancements.

Box 2: An internal Azure Standard Load Balancer

The internet to web tier is the public interface, while the web tier to application tier should be internal.

>**Note:** When using load-balancing rules with Azure Load Balancer, you need to specify a health probes to allow Load Balancer to detect the backend endpoint status.

Health probes support the TCP, HTTP, HTTPS protocols.

### Answer 157

**CORRECT ANSWER:**

![](image/image-438.webp)

**Explanation:**

Box 1: Scale set

A virtual machine scale set allows you to deploy and manage a set of identical, autoscaling virtual machines.

Box 2: Availability Set

An Availability Set is a logical grouping capability for isolating VM resources from each other when they're deployed. Azure makes sure that the VMs you place within an Availability Set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. If a hardware or software failure happens, only a subset of your VMs are impacted and your overall solution stays operational. Availability Sets are essential for building reliable cloud solutions.

Box 3: Fault domain

A fault domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an on-premises datacenter. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these fault domains. This approach limits the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

Incorrect Answers: 

An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.

Azure compute services, namely virtual machines (IaaS) and cloud services (PaaS), that are deployed within a virtual network can be connected through the private peering domain. The private peering domain is considered to be a trusted extension of your core network into Microsoft Azure.

Services such as Azure Storage, SQL databases, and Websites are offered on public IP addresses. You can privately connect to services hosted on public IP addresses, including VIPs of your cloud services, through the public peering routing domain. You can connect the public peering domain to your DMZ and connect to all Azure services on their public IP addresses from your WAN without having to connect through the internet.

### Answer 167

**CORRECT ANSWER:** D

**Explanation:**

Scenario: Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.

You can start an automated logic app workflow when specific events happen in Azure resources or third-party resources. These resources can publish those events to an Azure event grid. In turn, the event grid pushes those events to subscribers that have queues, webhooks, or event hubs as endpoints. As a subscriber, your logic app can wait for those events from the event grid before running automated workflows to perform tasks - without you writing any code.

The first thing you may want to do, before enabling Multi-Factor Authentication for any users, is to consider configuring some of the available settings. One of the most important features is a trusted IPs list.  This will allow you to whitelist a range of IPs for your network. This way, when users are in the office, they will not get prompted with MFA, and when they take their devices elsewhere, they will.  Here’s how to do it:

Log in to your Azure Portal.

Navigate to Azure AD > Conditional Access > Named locations.

From the top toolbar select Configure MFA trusted IPs.
